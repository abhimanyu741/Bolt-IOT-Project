# Bolt-IOT-Project
This was a short project I did during the conclusion of my Bolt IOT ML training program.

In this project, I generated a python code that could update and check for value of cryptocurrency every 30s. Following that, using an IOT device, I generated physical alerts with the help of led and buzzer indicators.

The code also generated digital alerts such as messages, email and telegram messages! This was the last bit of the graded course in which I achieved 84% marks.
